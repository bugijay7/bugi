            I'm a full-stack developer with years of experience building scalable products and user-focused web applications using the MERN and PERN stacks. 
            I've worked with individuals and cross-functional teams to deliver solutions for startups, SMEs, 
            and global companies including Wise, Google, Interswitch, and Intelia.
            <br /><br />
            Each project is a chance to deepen my understanding of both backend architecture 
            and frontend designâ€”while learning from concepts that intersect with technology,
            design, and problem-solving across fields like mathematics, physics, and the arts.
